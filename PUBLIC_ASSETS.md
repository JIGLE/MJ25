Place your custom hero image here so the Home page uses it:

- Path to put the file (project root): public/assets/hero-custom.jpg

Notes:
- The code was updated to point the hero to /assets/hero-custom.jpg.
- You can replace the filename if you prefer (update the paths in:
  - src/components/HeroSection.jsx
  - src/pages/HomePage.module.css
).
- For optimal results, create a large image (1920px wide or more). WebP/AVIF variants are supported if you add them and update the hero manifest.

After adding the image, reload the dev server or refresh the site to see it.
